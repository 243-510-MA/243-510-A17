* Function:         void main(void)

* PreCondition:     none

* Input:		    none

* Output:		    none
*
* Side Effects:	    none
*
* Overview:		    This is the main function that runs the simple 
*                   example demo. The purpose of this example is to
*                   demonstrate the simple application programming
*                   interface for the MiWi(TM) Development 
*                   Environment. By virtually total of less than 30 
*                   lines of code, we can develop a complete 
*                   application using MiApp interface. The 
*                   application will first try to establish a
*                   link with another device and then process the 
*                   received information as well as transmit its own 
*                   information.
*                   MiWi(TM) DE also support a set of rich 
*                   features. Example code FeatureExample will
*                   demonstrate how to implement the rich features 
*                   through MiApp programming interfaces.
