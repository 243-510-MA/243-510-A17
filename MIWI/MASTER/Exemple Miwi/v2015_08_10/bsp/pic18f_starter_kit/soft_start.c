	Function:
		void AppPowerEnable(void)
		
 	Summary:
 		This function starts the soft start process for the PIC18F starter kit.

 	Description:
 		This function starts the soft start process for the PIC18F starter kit.
        This function is optional if APP_POWER_AUTO_ENABLE is defined. 	
		
	PreCondition:
		Timer 2, Timer 4, and CCP1 are available.
		
	Parameters:
		None
		
	Return Values:
		None
		
	Remarks:
        This function uses Timer 2, Timer 4, CCP1, and one I/O pin.  When the
        AppPowerReady() function returns TRUE, the timers and CCP1 have been 
        reset to their reset values and are no longer in use and can be used by 
        the user application.  The I/O pin should not be manipulated.

 	Summary:
       This function determines if the soft start process is complete or not.

 	Description:
        This function determines if the soft start process is complete or not.
        if the APP_POWER_AUTO_ENABLE feature is defined then calling this
        function will also start the soft start process without having to call
        the AppPowerEnable() function.
		
	PreCondition:
		None
		
	Parameters:
		None
		
	Return Values:
		TRUE - the application power is fully ramped and ready.  This also
        indicates that the timer and CCP resources are now available for
        application use (see Remarks).
        FALSE - the applicatoin power is not ready.  See Remarks section for
        details about the auto-start option.
		
	Remarks:
		This function uses Timer 2, Timer 4, CCP1, and one I/O pin.  When this
        function returns TRUE, the timers and CCP1 have been reset to their
        reset values and are no longer in use and can be used by the user
        application.  The I/O pin should not be manipulated.

        If APP_POWER_AUTO_ENABLE is defined, then this function will
        automatically start the application power if it is not already started.
        If APP_POWER_AUTO_ENABLE is not defined then AppPowerEnable() must
        be called to start the application power.
